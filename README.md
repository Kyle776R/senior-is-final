As long as your Python virtual environment can support the `math`, `random`, and `graphics.py` libraries, everything should work as intended. Simply run a file of your choosing and adjust parameters as necessary. Files are broken up into two main folders:

- complex-csp-work
  1. collect_data_model_A
  2. collect_data_model_B
  3. create_graphs_path_creation
  4. **path_creation_model_A**
  5. **path_creation_model_B**
- simple-csp-work
  1. **agent_algorithm_1**
  2. **agent_algorithm_2**
  3. algorithm_1_collect_data
  4. algorithm_2_collect_data
  5. create_graphs
  
The most important of these files are bolded, which are the four different algorithms mentioned in the I.S. Thesis. The other files are used for data collection and generating graphs based off of the collected data.
